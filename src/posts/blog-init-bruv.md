The year is 2012, teacher is about to recite an essay that we have to write, but keeping up with her is difficult, my hand feels like it's about to have a stroke and I'm constantly peeking over my friends books because I've already fallen behind. Writing with a pen has always been a terrible sport for me, my handwriting isn't that good and I have a very unorthodox way of holding a pen which makes me a lot slower that everybody else. Coming last at everything that involved writing was my forte, dictation tests, essays and even exams. So naturally the frustration built up over the years and I mostly stayed away from articulating my thoughts on a paper.

But typing is where the tables were turned. I can type at great speed, almost 90-100 wpm! Although I have never wrote any blogs and only started *seriously* taking notes a few months ago. So without a doubt this blog's primary goal is to force me to write more and get rid of old habits because writing builds your network, help revisit important or silly ideas and improve your thinking. If these aren't good enough reasons to write then remember the entire civilization is built on knowledge that has been passed down through written communication. That being said, I do have some thought dumps in personal notes but none of that stuff is mature or interesting to read hence I decided to write publicy because,

So I'm sat here on a lazy Saturday morning comtemplating what to write about. Thinking is easy, putting thoughts into words is hard. Going from an abstract mental process to elaborate actionable instructions that everybody can understand is sometimes or most of the times too difficult, I just got a brain fart thinking about this. But writing in the *flow* is a wonderful feeling and it's not at all about the choice of words or the sophistication of your writing but the will to just not stop is what makes it more enjoyable. All the other things come naturally over time.

Thought about starting a tech blog when I was in college, after giving this some thought and reading some of the stuff that's out there I immediately felt stupid and my knowledgebase was severely limited but 5 years later I can still see people writing about the same stupid things that I would think of. And yes even in the ChatGPT era other people including me are still reading these dumb blogs, because you can generate text but you cannot generate experiences. So writing about tech now is a no brainer. Other than this I'll write about my observations and rabbit hole researches on cool abstract topics.

The truth is there is no format for this blog and I'm not confident I can deliver but that's okay. Been procastinating about starting a blog for a few years now, what really made me bite the bullet was this thing that I read somewhere.

If you have something that you've been putting off for a really long time this is your reminder to just do it.
